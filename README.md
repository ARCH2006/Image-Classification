# Convolutional Deep Neural Network for Image Classification

## AIM

To Develop a convolutional deep neural network for image classification and to verify the response for new images.

## Problem Statement and Dataset
Develop a Fashion Item Classification System using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The model should accurately categorize grayscale images of clothing items into one of 10 classes, such as T-shirts, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots.

```

```python
# Train the Model
def train_model(model, train_loader, num_epochs=3):

    # write your code here

        
        
        
        print('Name:        ')
        print('Register Number:       ')
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {running_loss/len(train_loader):.4f}')
